## whoami
I'm a passionate DevOps engineer and Data Science enthusiast. I have experience in software development, application lifecycle management, and infrastructure automation. I love turning complex technical challenges into elegant, efficient solutions.
Whenever you find me designing a multi-tier architecture, developing a web API or soldering a serial port on my home IoT device I think that everything is an opportunity to learn and I approach each task with curiosity and determination.

## When I'm not in the Matrix...
You might find me serving up aces on the tennis court, shooting a portrait with my camera, or diving into the latest tech literature. I believe in the power of continuous learning and community whether that's through IT conferences or submitting pull requests to projects I'm passionate about.

## What I `git commit` to
If you're looking for the usual things to put on your resume, but also with an element of truth, this is the right section!

1. **User-Centric Mindset**: Whether I'm building infrastructure or developing applications, I always keep the end-user in mind. Technology should make lives easier, not more complicated.
2. **Simplicity Seeker**: I like to take over complex problems and turning them into elegant, efficient solutions.
3. **Learner and Deep diver**: The tech world never stands still, and neither do I. Whenever I'm looking at a cloud infrastructure or an IoT device you will find me breaking it in pieces to see how it's done.
4. **Quality Craftsman**: In my book, "good enough" is never good enough. I strive for excellence in every line of code, every system design, and every project I undertake.
5. **Collaboration**: I believe the best innovations come from diverse minds working together. I'm always eager to share knowledge, learn from others, and contribute to a team's success.
